Questions:

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to informally brainstorm and walk through functionality they plan to build. For example, between design and development, a programmer may identify algorithms they need to write, and write out each step that should happen within the algorithm using pseudocode. 

Because pseudocode is language-agnostic, I could also see larger teams that code in many languages utilizing pseudocode to help determine what language would be best for certain projects.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Likely, nothing! Or you’ll receive a ton of errors, but nothing will actually be read and rendered by your computer, because pseudocode isn’t a programming language, and doesn’t produce machine-readable code.

Programming Assignment:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT the first number.
INPUT the second number.
IF the first number is greater than the second number,
	PRINT the first number.
ELSE if the second number is greater than the first number, 
	PRINT the second number.

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INPUT the variable X.
Set X’s value to 1.
Increment X’s value by 1.
WHILE X is less than or equal to 100,
	PRINT X.

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT an entry, and an array.
SEARCH for the index of the entry.
RETURN the index of the entry.

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


function findMe(entry, array) {
	return array.indexOf(entry)
}
