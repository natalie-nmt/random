1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

You might flip through a cooking magazine (if you don't want to use the index, or if the index doesn't exist) until you find a recipe you'd like to make for dinner. Most likely, you'll search the magazine from the beginning to the end, one page at a time, until you find what you're looking forâ€”very similar to trying to find a particular value in an array using a linear search.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

You might use a binary search if you read the index of that same magazine, and saw a recipe at page 39 that you want to read. So, you flip to the center of the magazine and look at the page number: 50. So then you select the middle page between 0 and 50: 25. And so on, until you get to the correct page. 

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

Seven.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

Three.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I'd use a linear search, because a binary search can only be performed on a sorted collection. 

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I'd use a binary search, because the list is sorted and because it's generally faster to find an item using binary search in a list/collection of that size.


Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

var webster = ['Able', 'Albatross', 'Severed', 'Zebra']

 function findInDictionary(dictionary, word) {
   var result = null;
   for (var i = 0; i < dictionary.length; i++) {
     let value = dictionary[i];
     if (value === word) {
       result = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   if (result !== null) {
     return word + ' can be found at index ' + result + ' in the dictionary.';
   }
   return 'That word does not exist in the dictionary.'
 }

 findInDictionary(webster, 'Albatross')

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var bubbleEye = {
  type: 'bubble eye',
  color: 'orange and white'
}

var blackMoor = {
  type: 'black moor',
  color: 'black'
}

var comet = {
  type: 'comet',
  color: 'orange'
}

var fanTail = {
  type: 'fanTail',
  color: 'white-spotted'
}

var aquarium = [bubbleEye, blackMoor, fanTail, comet]

function findGoldfish(tank, fish) {
  var result = null;
  for (var i = 0; i < tank.length; i++) {
    let value = tank[i].color;
    if (value === 'white-spotted') {
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return "Caught the fish at index " + result
}

findGoldfish(aquarium, 'white-spotted')
